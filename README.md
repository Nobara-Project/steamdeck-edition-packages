This repo contains the sources for the various packages used in Nobara's Steam Deck Edition which are added on top of a KDE base install. If you are looking for the package spec sheets for building the sources into RPMs, you will find them at https://github.com/Nobara-Project/rpm-sources under the baseos folder.

Note:
The following are in place simply as reminders to add them to steamdeck builds and do -not- require a tarball to be generated, as they are pulled directly from valve in the spec sheets:

jupiter-fan-control
steam-powerbuttond
steamdeck-dsp
steamdeck-firmware
