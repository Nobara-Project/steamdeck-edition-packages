This repo contains the sources for the various packages used in Nobara's Steam Deck Edition which are added on top of a KDE base install. If you are looking for the package spec sheets for building the sources into RPMs, you will find them at https://github.com/Nobara-Project/rpm-sources under the baseos folder.

Note:
steamdeck-dsp and steamdeck-firmware are pulled directly from valve's repositories in the spec sheet, so a tarball is not needed/created for them. The folders here are just a mirror/reminder that they are part of the required packages for the steamdeck version.
